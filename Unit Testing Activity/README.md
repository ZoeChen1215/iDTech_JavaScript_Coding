# Unit Testing Activity
In this activity, we will walk you through a list of requirements for a function. Your task is to provide a list of possible Unit Tests that will cover these requirements. For each step in the listed requirements, create the unit tests that you believe will capture the specific requirement. 

You need to write the unit tests, and implement the function Greet() described below, then upload a screenshot of your work.
